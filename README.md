## Running Project
	Ensure that flex-layout, angular material, and chart js is installed.
	If not, cd into project folder and npm install

	Once all dependencies are installed, run ng serve --open and click the load data button.
	The data should be loaded under 1 minute.

## Planned changes:
   * Create base components to display charts and change current classes for statistics to pass data to those charts to be displayed.
   * Enable toggle for time frame of the charts instead of displaying them all at once.
   * Allow users to view two characters side by side for comparison.

## Current Issues:
   * New players have missing fields in their data. Need to revise the way I grab information for certain statistics.
